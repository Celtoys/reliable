DONE

    Implement RTT estimate

    Create stats program to test it.

    Add prints for smoothed rtt

    Can't do jitter estimate because we don't include time in sent packets.

    Jitter estimate needs to be done at some level above reliable.io, where we know the time value per-packet.

    Implement packet loss estimate and smooth it.

    RTT estimate is not smooth. Make it better be only considering RTT on packets that are subsequent receives, eg. try to avoid dropped packets affecting the RTT estimate.

    Various fixes for linux, windows etc.

    All done. Ready for 1.0 release!

TODO

    Adjust interface in combination with netcode.io to eliminate buffer copies when reading and writing packets.
