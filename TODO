DONE

    Implement RTT estimate

    Create stats program to test it.

    Add prints for smoothed rtt

    Can't do jitter estimate because we don't include time in sent packets.

    Jitter estimate needs to be done at some level above reliable.io, where we know the time value per-packet.

    Implement packet loss estimate and smooth it.

    RTT estimate is not smooth. Make it better be only considering RTT on packets that are subsequent receives, eg. try to avoid dropped packets affecting the RTT estimate.

    ^--- Works great!

TODO

    Next step is to integrate this into yojimbo and create a client/server test that prints out RTT and packet loss estimate every few seconds.

    This way I can test between a client and real server running on linode.
