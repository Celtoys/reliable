    Implement RTT estimate

    Create stats program to test it.

    Add prints for smoothed rtt

    Implement jitter estimate

    To implement this correctly, only consider jitter on packets that are in sequence.

    So for example, if an ack comes in for a packet, and the previous sequence number has already been acked, then we have the time between the packets at send.

    Then we can look at the time between ack for these packets, and use this to calculate jitter from receiver back to sender, which is actually a true one way jitter.

    I think this is correct, and then we just smooth this the same way rtt is being smoothed.

    Implement packet loss estimate

    Algorithm for this should be to look at the end of the sequence buffer for sent packets, and whenever it is advanced past an unacked packet, that counts as a lost packet.

    This should be reasonably straightforward, provided that insertions in the sent packet buffer are well controlled (they are...)
