    8:30AM - Start work on reliable.io.

        This is the separation of the reliability system out of yojimbo, plus the addition of MTU fragmentation and reassembly.

        It is intended to make it possible to easily port to multiple languages, like C#, Golang, Rust etc.

        Its features will be:

            - pure c reference implementation

            - reliability system (eg. sequence, acks, ack bits)

            - an interface to get acks for packets via data structure, not callback (eg. get array of acks)

            - round trip time and packet loss estimates

            - BBR congestion avoidance (via notification, not immediate throttling)

            - MTU packet fragmentation and reassembly

            - config struct that must be the same on both endpoints in order for the protocol to be compatible
