    8:30AM - Start work on reliable.io.

        This is the separation of the reliability system out of yojimbo.

        It is intended to make it possible to port these aspects of yojimbo to muliple languages, like C#, Golang, Rust etc.

        Its features will be:

            - pure c reference implementation

            - reliability system (eg. sequence, acks, ack bits)

            - an interface to get acks for packets via data structure, not callback (eg. get array of acks)

            - round trip time and packet loss estimates

            - 

            - MTU fragmentation and reassembly
